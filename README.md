## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is an HTML & CSS-only challenge  perfect for starting to build responsive projects. Here's a snippet of the CSS code where I used Flexbox which I'm proud of:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: var(--Cream);
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to get better on working with HTML, CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand FLexbox.
