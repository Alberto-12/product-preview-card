## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to work with Flebox.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: var(--Cream);
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to get better on working with HTML, CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand FLexbox.
